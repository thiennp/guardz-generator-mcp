```

#### **Day 4: Use Case**
```
🔍 Real-world use case: API validation

Instead of manually writing type guards for API responses:

const response = await fetch('/api/users');
const data = await response.json();

// Let AI generate this automatically:
export function isUserResponse(value: unknown): value is UserResponse {
  return isObject(value) && isUser((value as UserResponse).data);
}
