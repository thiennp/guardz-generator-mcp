**Content**:
```
Hi TypeScript Weekly team,

I'd like to submit my new project for consideration in your newsletter:

**guardz-generator-mcp** - An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants to generate TypeScript type guards for runtime validation.

## Key Features:
- 6 AI-powered tools for type guard generation
- Integrates with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
- Zero configuration setup
- Open source and community-driven

## Example:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

AI generates:
```typescript
export function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return (
    isObject(value) &&
    isString((value as User).id) &&
    isString((value as User).name) &&
    isString((value as User).email)
  );
}
```

## Links:
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/guardz-generator-mcp
- GitHub: https://github.com/thiennp/guardz-generator-mcp
- Documentation: https://github.com/thiennp/guardz-generator-mcp#readme

This tool bridges the gap between TypeScript's compile-time type safety and runtime validation, making it easier for developers to maintain type safety throughout their applications.

Thanks for considering!

Best regards,
