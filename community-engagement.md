### MCP Discord Server
```
Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I've just released a new MCP server that generates TypeScript type guards from source code: https://github.com/thiennp/guardz-generator-mcp

**What it does:**
- Takes TypeScript interfaces and generates runtime type guards
- Works with 30+ MCP clients (Claude, VS Code, Warp, etc.)
- Zero configuration needed
- Includes post-processing (linting, formatting, validation)

**Why it's useful:**
Bridges the gap between compile-time and runtime type safety, making it easier to work with external APIs and dynamic data while maintaining type safety.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g guardz-generator-mcp
```

Would love feedback from the community! ðŸš€

### TypeScript Discord Server

Hi TypeScript community! ðŸ‘‹

I've built an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that generates TypeScript type guards from your source code: https://github.com/thiennp/guardz-generator-mcp

**Key features:**
- Generates runtime type guards from TypeScript interfaces
- Works with AI assistants like Claude, VS Code Copilot
- Zero configuration setup
- Includes post-processing (linting, formatting, validation)

**Example:**
```typescript
// Input interface
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number;
}

// Generated type guard
export function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return (
    isObject(value) &&
    isString((value as User).id) &&
    isString((value as User).name) &&
    isString((value as User).email) &&
    ((value as User).age === undefined || isNumber((value as User).age))
  );
}
```

This helps maintain type safety when working with external APIs and dynamic data. Would love your thoughts! ðŸš€

## Stack Overflow Answer Template

**Question**: "How to generate TypeScript type guards automatically?"

**Answer**:
```
You can use the `guardz-generator-mcp` MCP server to automatically generate TypeScript type guards from your interfaces.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g guardz-generator-mcp
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "guardz-generator": {
      "command": "guardz-generator-mcp",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example:**
```typescript
// Your interface
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number;
}

// Generated type guard
export function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return (
    isObject(value) &&
    isString((value as User).id) &&
    isString((value as User).name) &&
    isString((value as User).email) &&
    ((value as User).age === undefined || isNumber((value as User).age))
  );
}
```

This works with AI assistants like Claude, VS Code Copilot, and many other MCP clients. It bridges the gap between compile-time and runtime type safety.

## Conference Talk Proposal

**Title**: "Bridging Compile-Time and Runtime Type Safety with MCP"

**Abstract**:
TypeScript provides excellent compile-time type safety, but runtime type safety is often overlooked. This talk explores how to bridge this gap using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to generate TypeScript type guards automatically.

We'll dive into building an MCP server that generates runtime validation functions from TypeScript interfaces, making type safety accessible to AI assistants and developers alike.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Understanding the importance of runtime type safety
- Building MCP servers for developer tools
- Integrating AI assistants with type safety workflows
- Contributing to the growing MCP ecosystem

**Target Audience**: TypeScript developers, AI tool builders, MCP enthusiasts
